# Liftit — Project Context

> Read this first if you're a new session picking up this project. Everything you need to be productive is here.

> **MAINTENANCE RULE (do not skip):** Every time you make a code change in this project, update this file in the same commit. Sections to keep current: file map, data model, XP system, bodygraph implementation, "things to NOT do", and the recent-changes note at the bottom. If you add a new file, list it. If you change a behavior the user relies on (XP formula, schema, tier colors, etc.), update the explanation.

## What this is

A gamified, mobile-first workout tracker. Track lifts → level up muscles → climb ranks → beat friends. Currently deployed to GitHub Pages, with a Supabase backend powering accounts, leaderboard, and image storage.

**Live URL:** `https://trislovesu.github.io/liftoff/`
**Repo:** github.com/Trislovesu/liftoff

**Owner / primary user:** Tristan (username preferences: simple, direct, prefers terse answers, dislikes filler).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion + React Router (`HashRouter` because GH Pages)
- **Backend:** Supabase — Postgres (RPC-only access via SECURITY DEFINER functions) + Storage (public bucket)
- **Auth:** custom username + 4–8 digit PIN, SHA-256 hashed client-side with salt `liftit::v1`. No Supabase Auth, no email.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages via Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). Set `base: './'` in `vite.config.js` and `HashRouter` to avoid SPA 404s.
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage cache (`liftit.local.v1`, `liftit.session.v1`) + Supabase for cloud sync. UI updates instantly; cloud catches up via debounced `rpcSaveState` ~1.2s after state changes.

## Critical: external infra the user manages

1. **Supabase project URL + anon key** — hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase.js`. Safe to commit (RLS-locked).
2. **Supabase Storage bucket `user-content`** — must exist, public, with policies for anon insert+select (defined in `supabase/schema.sql`).
3. **GitHub Actions workflow permissions** — Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write permissions".

If a new session needs to re-run the schema: paste `supabase/schema.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor. If a function signature changes, may need to `drop function if exists public.<fn_name>(...);` first because Postgres won't change return types.

## Data model (Supabase users table → AppContext shape)

The `app_save_state` RPC writes these fields back. The user object in React state is:

```js
{
  username, totalXP, weeklyXP, weekStart, streak, lastWorkoutDate,
  muscles: [{name, level, xp}],
  personalBests: { [exerciseKey]: { weight, reps } },
  lastSessions:  { [exerciseKey]: { weight, reps, date } },  // drives "last time" hints
  totalWorkouts,            // replaced streak as headline gym stat
  profilePicUrl,            // URL (Supabase storage) OR emoji char OR null
  gymType                   // 'gym', 'home', or null from signup onboarding
}
```

`exerciseKey` is `libraryId || ex.name`.

`pump_photos` table is separate: `{ id, username, image_url, taken_at, caption, xp_bonus, created_at }`.

`gym_status` table is a single-row global status object for Highway Plaza / SunPlaza:
`{ id: 1, locations: [{ key, name, detail, status }], message, updated_by, updated_at }`.
Statuses are `open`, `closing_soon`, `closed`. Admin updates are restricted in SQL to username `tris` with a valid PIN hash. The row is public-read and added to `supabase_realtime`, and admin saves also send a direct Realtime broadcast so connected users receive status changes immediately without refresh. The client logs a console warning if the Realtime channel cannot subscribe.

## XP system (v2 — current)

Per completed set:
```
xp = (10 + weight*0.15 + reps*1.2 + (weight*reps)*0.04 + (50 if PR))
     * (1 + min(1.2, (weight*reps)/1800))
```

Heavy compound sets get up to ~2.2× multiplier. Bodyweight high-rep sets still give meaningful XP.

Per workout:
- Sum of set XP
- + `WORKOUT_COMPLETION_BONUS` (25) — flat bonus per finished workout
- + `PUMP_PIC_BONUS` (75) if a pump pic was attached at finish

Muscle XP from a workout: primary muscle gets 70% of an exercise's XP, secondaries get 15% each.

Profile level curve: `100 * level^1.4`. Muscle level curve: `200 + 50*level`.

Ranks (`RANKS` in `xp.js`): Bronze (0) → Silver (2500) → Gold (7500) → Platinum (15000) → Diamond (30000) → Master (60000) → Legend (100000).

## Muscle tiers (separate from ranks)

In `lib/tiers.js`. Each muscle has its own level → tier mapping (Bronze I → Master III, then Legend). Colors follow strength gradient: gray (untrained) → blue (Bronze) → teal (Silver) → gold (Gold) → orange (Platinum) → purple (Diamond/Master) → red (Legend).

## Bodygraph implementation

- Uses `src/assets/bodygraph.png` (a static muscle-anatomy reference image) as the visual base.
- 30 SVG `<path>` overlay zones positioned with percent coords (viewBox 0–100, `preserveAspectRatio="none"`). Multiple paths can share a muscle name (eg, left+right pec both = "Chest", and "Back" has 4 paths: traps spear + L/R lat wings + center lower-back).
- **Resting state is intentionally subtle** — untrained muscles are invisible, ranked muscles show only a faint tinted outline. Tier glow + animation (`tier-diamond`, `tier-master`, `tier-legend` keyframes in `index.css`) fires *only when that muscle is selected*, not constantly. This was a deliberate change after feedback that the always-on glow was distracting.
- **Built-in overlay editor:** flip `EDIT_MODE = true` in `FrontBackBodyMap.jsx` to use. Supports:
  - **Drag** any overlay to reposition
  - **Arrow keys** nudge selected by 0.5 (Shift = 0.1)
  - **Muscle dropdown** in panel: relabel any overlay's muscle on the fly
  - **🗑 Delete / Delete key** removes the selected overlay (with confirm)
  - **✎ Draw New** enters polygon-draw mode: click points on the body (≥3), pick muscle from dropdown, Enter/✓ Finish closes the path and appends it. Backspace undoes last point, Esc cancels.
  - **In-SVG label tag** shows selected overlay's muscle name floating near its centroid
  - **Copy Paths** exports the final OVERLAYS array (drawn + deleted + relabeled + nudged all baked in)
- There's also `DEBUG_OVERLAYS` flag for static red-hitbox visualization without the editor panel.
- Internal model: the editor stores everything in a single `items` array (`{ muscle, d, transform }`), not separate arrays for transforms/drafts/deletes. Cleaner state, easier export.

## Pump pic flow

1. WorkoutLogger.FinishModal or Gallery upload → `<input type="file" capture="environment">`
2. `checkPhotoIsRecent(file)` in `lib/exifDate.js` reads JPEG EXIF DateTimeOriginal, falls back to `file.lastModified`.
3. If photo > 2 hours old → reject with a random funny line from `funnyRejects.js`.
4. If ok → `uploadImage(file, 'pumps', username)` → public URL.
5. `rpcSavePumpPhoto` writes a row to `pump_photos`.
6. Finish modal adds +75 XP bonus; finalized in reducer's `LOG_WORKOUT` action.

## Things to NOT do unless asked

- Don't add streaks back. Replaced with `totalWorkouts`.
- Don't add fake currencies (gems, coins, diamonds, loot). Stick to fitness stats.
- Don't add AI workout generation. Manual lift logging only.
- Don't add custom exercise creation in the builder — only library exercises (muscle mapping depends on it).
- Don't add payments.
- Don't redesign the bodygraph from scratch. The image is the visual source of truth; we only adjust overlays.
- Don't change unrelated pages when asked to fix one thing.

## Style notes / preferences

- Tristan likes short, direct answers — no filler, no recaps, no "I'm now going to…" prefaces.
- No emojis in code unless they're already used or it's user-facing UI text where they fit.
- Kinetic Dark Redux theme from Stitch: deep charcoal surfaces (`#0a0a0a`, `#131313`, `#1a1a1a`) with primary red accent `#ff0033`.
- Typography uses Sora for bold/headline/metric moments and Geist for body/UI text, loaded in `index.html`.
- Mobile-first. The "viewport" is a single column max-w-md mx-auto.
- Persisted user data must never break across deploys. Use `JSON.parse` try/catch + null fallback in storage helpers.

## Visual design conventions (current)

- **Buttons:** Kinetic Dark Redux — primary is solid red with subtle red glow; ghost is charcoal with red stroke. Defined in `src/index.css` under `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost`.
- **Cards:** `.card` is the general charcoal card. `.glass-card` and `.glass-input` are the Stitch screenshot primitives for the redesigned screens.
- **Navigation:** Authed pages use fixed `AppTopBar` plus the fixed glass `BottomNav`. Page content starts below the top bar through `App.jsx` padding.
- **Body overlays:** rest = invisible/dim outline only; selected = soft tier-color glow + white stroke. Tier pulse/fire only when selected. **Don't** restore always-on glow.

## Common gotchas

- **`base: './'` + HashRouter** required for GH Pages — don't change.
- **Postgres RPC return-type changes** require `DROP FUNCTION` first.
- **Storage bucket `user-content`** must be PUBLIC, otherwise image URLs 401.
- **HEIC photos** don't have parseable EXIF in our reader → falls back to `file.lastModified`. Works but less trustworthy.
- **PWA-like camera capture** uses `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">`. On desktop browsers this just opens a file picker.
- **Workouts and history are PER-USER and stored in LocalStorage**, not in Supabase yet. Only the user profile + pump photos sync. To make workouts follow users across devices, lift them into Supabase later.
- **Mock leaderboard data** (`src/data/mockLeaderboard.js`) is no longer used but kept for reference.
- **Exercise GIF/media cache** is optional. `src/lib/exerciseMedia.js` warms `liftit.exerciseMedia.v1` from WorkoutX only when `VITE_WORKOUTX_API_KEY` exists; otherwise the builder falls back to local white-background exercise thumbnails.

## Quick commands

```powershell
# Run dev server
cd D:\Liftit
npm run dev

# Push
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push

# Re-run schema after editing supabase/schema.sql:
# paste it into Supabase → SQL Editor → Run. If a function returns table:
# drop function if exists public.<fn>(...);
```

## What's NOT built yet (logical next moves)

- Photo verification — confirm it's actually the user (deferred from the pump pic feature).
- Workouts + history syncing to Supabase (currently per-device per-user via LocalStorage).
- Friend system (currently anyone with an account shows in leaderboard).
- Push notifications for streak reminders / friend activity.
- Visual rank-up celebration when a muscle / profile hits a new tier.

## File-by-file summary of what each major file does

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `App.jsx` | Routes. Authed-only routes wrapped in a `status === 'authed'` guard; includes Dianna-only login intro before entering the app. |
| `store/AppContext.jsx` | The store. Reducer handles `BOOT_UNAUTHED`, `AUTH_SUCCESS`, Dianna login intro state, `LOG_WORKOUT` (computes XP, muscles, lastSessions, totalWorkouts), `SAVE_WORKOUT`, `PATCH_USER`. Exposes `actions = { signup, login, signOut, setProfilePic, saveWorkout, deleteWorkout, logWorkout }`. Debounced cloud sync via `rpcSaveState`. |
| `lib/supabase.js` | Client + `hashPin`, RPC helpers, gym-status and leaderboard realtime subscription/broadcast helpers, and `uploadImage`. |
| `lib/gymStatus.js` | Global gym-status location constants, default status, status colors, and normalizer. |
| `lib/exerciseMedia.js` | Optional WorkoutX media warmer/cache for exercise GIFs, keyed by exercise name in LocalStorage. |
| `lib/xp.js` | `RANKS`, `rankFor`, `rankIndex`, `levelFromXP`, `muscleProgress`, `applyMuscleXP`, `xpForSet`, `WORKOUT_COMPLETION_BONUS`, `PUMP_PIC_BONUS`, `sanityCheckSet`. |
| `lib/tiers.js` | `TIERS` + `tierForLevel(level)`. Color ramp matches user's strength legend. |
| `data/muscles.js` | Muscle group names + red-edition status colors used by preview cards. |
| `lib/exifDate.js` | `readPhotoTakenAt` + `checkPhotoIsRecent` (uses funny rejections). |
| `lib/funnyRejects.js` | `funnyOldPhotoReject(ageMs)`, `randomCompliment()`, `lastTimeNudge(weight, reps)`. |
| `components/Avatar.jsx` | `<Avatar user size ring />`. Handles URL vs emoji vs initial. |
| `components/AppTopBar.jsx` | Fixed top brand bar matching the Stitch red screenshots; glowing Z opens gym status. Admin controls and account list appear only for `tris`; admin update messages appear as a themed on-screen alert outside the Z panel. |
| `components/SignupOnboarding.jsx` | Animated post-signup flow: upload photo or choose emoji, then choose Gym/Home training setup. |
| `components/FrontBackBodyMap.jsx` | THE bodygraph. Image + overlays + full editor (drag/draw/delete/relabel) gated behind `EDIT_MODE` constant. |
| `pages/Dashboard.jsx` | Home dashboard. Weekly Progress charts weekly lifted weight volume, Level and Rank metric cards open minimal themed detail sheets, Muscle Fatigue uses recent workout history with 42-72h decay estimates. |
| `pages/WorkoutBuilder.jsx` | Custom routine flow from Stitch: home/search, create-new muscle selection up to 3, organized library, and routine editor with Add from library. |
| `pages/WorkoutLogger.jsx` | Log sets. `FinishModal` asks for pump pic → Supabase storage → +75 XP. |
| `pages/Gallery.jsx` | Pump pic feed + standalone upload. |
| `supabase/schema.sql` | Schema, RPCs, storage policies. Idempotent. |

## Recent changes log

Newest at top. Keep this trimmed to the last ~10 entries — older context is captured in the file map / sections above.

- **Dianna custom profile:** created Supabase user `dianna` with PIN `6767` and heart avatar. Logging in as Dianna triggers a one-time smooth themed intro with a heart and the text `hello my beatiful helper`, then carries her into the app normally. Intro is login-only, not shown on refresh/boot, and does not affect other users.
- **Polish/onboarding/fatigue pass:** Weekly Progress now charts weekly lifted weight volume instead of XP. Added global transition polish and route fade-ins. New signups go through animated avatar/emoji selection followed by Gym/Home setup (`gym_type` in Supabase). Leaderboard refreshes live through Realtime broadcast after cloud sync. Dashboard `Muscle Rankings` became `Muscle Fatigue`, calculated from recent logged muscle work with a 42-72 hour recovery decay and tap-for-estimate detail sheet. Bottom Body tab is disabled/gray for now.
- **Gym update alert:** admin `Update message` no longer appears inside the Z status dropdown. When a new gym status message is pushed, users see a dismissible themed alert on the main screen; message seen-state is separate from opening the Z panel, and incoming messages close the panel so the alert is visible. The Z button still shows the small red unread indicator.
- **Realtime gym status + leaner dashboard:** gym status now subscribes to Supabase Realtime and admin saves broadcast directly to connected users without refresh; subscription/broadcast failures warn in the browser console. Dashboard welcome keeps only the small welcome label; the large rotating motivation sentence was removed. Level detail sheet keeps only `Next milestone` and `Milestone XP needed` boxes; milestones are every 50 levels up to 500.
- **Dashboard stat detail sheets:** Level and Rank cards are now the only clickable metric cards. Level opens a clean path-to-500 sheet with current level progress and milestone XP. Rank opens the full rank ladder with current-rank indicator and XP to next rank. Workouts and Weekly XP remain non-interactive.
- **Workout library flow + status copy cleanup:** gym status popover now shows a bigger `Zion Fitness Status` label with no availability heading; location cards show `Highway Plaza` and `SunPlaza` only. WorkoutBuilder now follows the Stitch custom-routine flow: routine home first, Create New Routine reveals up-to-3 muscle selection, Next opens an organized library, and the editor only shows routine name plus `Add from library`. Added optional `exerciseMedia.js` cache for WorkoutX-style exercise GIF thumbnails with local fallback.
- **Cleanup + gym status/admin:** log cards and inputs made rounder; dashboard welcome now uses username + daily motivation; top-right bell replaced by glowing `Z` gym status popover for Zion Fitness House / Highway Plaza and SunPlaza; `tris` gets an admin-only panel to change status and view accounts; profile history is collapsed by default; dashboard advice card uses latest pump pic when available; schema adds `gym_status` + admin RPCs.
- **Stitch screenshot redesign pass:** Login, Dashboard, WorkoutLogger, AppTopBar, BottomNav, and core screenshot primitives now mirror the red-edition Stitch screens structurally: LIFTIT hero auth, fixed top brand bar, glass metric cards, dashboard line chart, recent lift rows, floating start button, active-session timer/completion header, dense set tables, and fixed finish CTA.
- **Stitch red theme applied:** app styling updated to Stitch's latest red edition, `Kinetic Dark Redux` (`#ff0033` accent, charcoal surfaces, Sora/Geist typography). Shared primitives (`.card`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.input`, progress bars, stat cards, bottom nav) and page-level leftovers across login, dashboard/stats overview, gallery, leaderboard, builder modal, and profile modal now inherit the red edition.
- **Overlays fully redrawn:** Tristan used the editor's Draw Mode to retrace every muscle from scratch. New layout has 30 paths total (4 Glutes paths instead of 2, polyline-style shapes instead of bezier curves for most zones). Some muscles missing from the new pass (hamstrings on back, rhomboids) — if needed, redraw via the editor again.
- **Editor v2 (FrontBackBodyMap):** added Draw mode (click points to define a polygon), Delete selected, muscle-relabel dropdown, in-SVG label tag, unified `items` state model in place of separate transforms array. `EDIT_MODE = true` flag at top of the file.
- **Visual polish:** body-map glow toned down (resting = faint outline only, glow + tier effects only when selected). Buttons modernized in `index.css` — glass gradient + white border + inset highlight + soft outer glow. Cards refined with translucent bg + backdrop blur + top-edge highlight.
- **Major feature pass:** ~75-exercise library; XP formula now volume-weighted (`(weight*reps)*0.04` bonus + multiplier up to 2.2×); streak replaced by `totalWorkouts` counter; Leagues/Analytics tabs removed (only Bodygraph + Gallery); Gallery is now a real pump-pic feed with EXIF check + funny rejection messages; profile pictures via Supabase Storage (or emoji default) — post-signup prompt + editable modal in Profile; workout history clickable → `/history/:id` shows full set/rep/weight breakdown; `lastSessions` drives subtle "last time" hint in WorkoutLogger; leaderboard rows use avatar instead of tier letter + new Rank sort tab; tier-glow effects on body map; muscle-group filter in WorkoutBuilder (relevance-sorted library); Custom-exercise button removed; sanity check before workout finish; Supabase schema v2 with `total_workouts`, `profile_pic_url`, `last_sessions` columns + `pump_photos` table + new RPCs.
